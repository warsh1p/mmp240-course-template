    <p>Tamales are a traditional Mexican dish made with a corn based dough mixture that is filled with various meats or beans and cheese. 
         Tamales are wrapped and cooked in corn husks or banana leaves, but they are removed from the husks before eating. 
        While making tamales is a process (made very fun with multiple people to help stuff and wrap them!), it's really simple, 
        so don't be intimidated! There are just two main elements; the dough, and the filling.
        
        </p>
         <h2> Ingredients: </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The dough "Masa in spanish". Maseca brand Masa Harina works best, & is the most common. </li>
        <li>The Filling. It could be beef, chicken or vegetable. Maybe even no filling!</li>
        <li>Baking powder</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Cumin</li>
        <li>Lard</li>
        <li>Dried corn husks</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> Step 1: Place the corn husks in a bowl of very hot water for 30 
            minutes or until softened.</li>
        <li> Step 2: You'll need about 3 and a half to 4 cups of filling for one batch of tamale
            dough. such fillings include
        </li>
        <ul> 
            <li> Salsa verde chicken: 3 ½ cups cooked, shredded chicken
                 mixed with 16 ounce can salsa verde.</li>
            <li> Bean and cheese: 15 oz can refried beans and 1 ½ cups shredded mozzarella cheese.</li>
            <li> Red chilli pork: 1 recipe red chilli pork.</li>
        </ul>
        <li> Step 3: In a large bowl, use an electric mixer to beat the lard and 2 tablespoons of broth 
            until fluffy, about 3-5 minutes. Combine the masa flour, baking powder, salt, and cumin in a 
            medium bowl; stir into the lard mixture and beat well with an electric mixer. Add the broth,
             little by little to form a very soft dough. Beat on high speed for several minutes. 
             The dough should spread like creamy peanut butter and be slightly sticky. Cover the mixing 
             bowl with a damp paper towel, to keep the dough from drying out.</li>
        <li> Step 4: Lay a corn husk, glossy side up, on the counter with the wide end at the top.
             Scoop about ¼ cup of dough onto the top, center of the corn husk. Lay a piece of 
             plastic wrap over the dough and use your hands to press and spread the masa into a thin 
             layer, about ¼ inch thick. Keep the dough spread along the top half of the corn husk to 
             allow plenty of room to fold the bottom husk up, when it's time.<br><br>

             Place 1-2 tablespoons of desired filling in a line down the center of the dough. 
             (You don't want too much filling). <br><br>

             Fold-in one long side of the husk over the filling. Fold in the other long side, overlapping
             the first (like folding a brochure). Fold the bottom of the husk up. Optional: Tear a long
             strip from an edge of one of the soaked corn husks and use it to tie the tamale, to hold it
             together. </li>
        <li> Step 5: Tie the tamales (optional): Tying the tamales can help you differentiate them if making
             more than one filling. However, you don't have to tie a corn husk string around them to secure 
             them, as they will hold together without it, stacked upright, side-by-side in the pot.</li>
        <li> Step 6: Cook on the stove or instant pot. Add water to the bottom of your stove-top steamer
             or Instant Pot pressure cooker. (About 1 cup for IP and a few cups for a steamer pot—don't 
             fill above the steamer rack.) Lay a few extra corn husks on the bottom rack to keep the 
             tamales from falling through and any boiling water from directly touching them.

            Place tamales standing upright, with the open end up, just tightly enough to keep them standing.
             If using a steamer, lay a few soaked corn husks or a wet towel over the top of the tamales
              before closing the lid. </li>
    </ul>
