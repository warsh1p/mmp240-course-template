    <h1>Ultimate Recipe For Tamales</h1>

    <p>Tamales are a traditional Mexican dish made with a corn based dough mixture that is filled with various meats or beans and cheese. 
         Tamales are wrapped and cooked in corn husks or banana leaves, but they are removed from the husks before eating. 
        While making tamales is a process (made very fun with multiple people to help stuff and wrap them!), it's really simple, 
        so don't be intimidated! There are just two main elements; the dough, and the filling.
